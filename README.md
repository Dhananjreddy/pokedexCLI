# Pokedex CLI — Go & TypeScript

Pokedex CLI is a REPL-style command-line Pokédex that interacts with the PokeAPI
 to explore Pokémon and location data. It’s available in both Go and TypeScript implementations. Users can navigate maps, explore areas, catch Pokémon, and view their Pokédex directly from the terminal.

The Go version focuses on performance and simplicity, ideal for learning idiomatic Go, while the TypeScript version emphasizes modular command design and includes an in-memory cache for faster responses. Both feature commands like map, explore, catch, inspect, and pokedex, offering an intuitive and engaging CLI experience.

Each version supports local builds (go build or npm run build), includes tests, and depends only on internet access to PokeAPI. Together, they serve as clean, educational examples of CLI development and API interaction in two popular programming languages.
